1.**CRASH!** I am a broken random name generator that could only generate 10 names per day...the names include names of vegetables, fruits, and other assortment of grocery items mixed up together. 
2.I am created in Winter 2002, when groceries options were scarce.
3.To use the software, please enter a password sandwich, (the word "lettuce" not accepted)
4.The software is also designed to inspire chefs with cookwriter's block, but so far the response has been negative. 
5.The software shuts **IMMEDIATELY** after dinnertime (To refresh the item names for the next day) and restarts at **10 P.M**, but with -80% working capacity. **SO SCHEDULE YOUR WORKING HOURS APPROPRIATELY**
